        <h2>What is Mafia?</h2>
        <p>
          Mafia is a social deduction game, created by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986.
          The game models a conflict between two groups: an informed minority (the
          Mafia team), and an uninformed majority (the Residents).

            Night Phase</h4>
            
              A night role during which those with night killing powers may covertly eliminate other players.
            </p>
            <p>             
              All players close their eyes. The GOD then instructs all Mafias to open their eyes and acknowledge their accomplices. The mafias suggest a "victim" by silently gesturing to indicate their target and to show unanimity then the Don (Mafia's head) should decide whom to be killed then close their eyes again.
            </p>
            <p>          
              A similar process occurs for other roles with nightly actions. In the case of the Detective role, the GOD may indicate the target's innocence or guilt by using gestures such as nodding or head shaking.

          Day Phase</h4>
          <p>
            A day role, in which surviving players debate the identities of players and vote to eliminate a suspect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The GOD instructs players to open their eyes. Discussion ensues among the living players. At any point, a player may accuse someone of being a mafia and prompt others to vote to eliminate them. If over half of the players do so, the accused person should go to the court. Players who go to the court may give a speech defending themselves from not being mafia. Then the GOD should take votes again and this time the player with maximum vote will be eliminated and night begins. Otherwise, the phase continues until an elimination occurs.
            Dead players are not permitted to attempt to influence the remainder of the game. Because players have more freedom to deliberate, days tend to be longer than nights.

          <h3>How to Win</h3>
          <p>
            The game continues until a faction achieves its win condition; for the Residents, this usually means eliminating the whole Mafia team, while for the minority this usually means reaching numerical parity with the Residents.
